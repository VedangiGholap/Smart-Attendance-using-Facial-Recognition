# Attendance-Tracker


In the realm of education, where attendance tracking remains a critical and labour intensive track, 
traditional method of manual signing in and card swaps are prone to be unauthentic.
To address this issues, facial recognition technology can play a significant role.
With future scopes of continuous monitoring in real-time, which is not the case with fingerprint identification, it is more convenient. 
Often, fingerprint recognition fails to work when fingers are wet, dirty, or injured, making it unreliable in certain situations.

This project is about managing and tracking the attendance of students using Facial Recognition technique.
